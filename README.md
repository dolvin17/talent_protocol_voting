How Does Votation System Work?

Principles of Community Voting:

    Voting as a cost: a small financial cost can help prevent bots and fake votes, ensuring an engaged and motivated voter base.

    Dynamic pricing: not all votes cost the same; voting on popular candidates, who are more likely to win, should cost more than voting on hidden gems.

    Voting cost increases linearly: the first vote costs 1 $TAL, the second 2 $TAL, the third 3 $TAL, and so on.

Fair usage tax: To reduce the impact of $TAL whales, it has been implemented a fair usage tax system that increases gradually the more votes a user cast on each candidate.

    How it works: TAX will be implemented based on the total amount of $TAL a user spent on an individual candidate. This means the TAX is for each individual and will not affect other votes.

    Tax per Total amount of $TAL spent on each candidate.

        0 to 150 $TAL → 0% fee

        100 to 500 $TAL → 2,5% fee

        500 to 1k $TAL → 5%

        1k to 5k $TAL → 10% fee

        5k to 10k $TAL → 20% fee

        > 10k $TAL → 25% fee
